    "# Sequential Backword Selection\n",
    "Sequential feature selection algorithms are a family of greedy search algorithms that are used to reduce an initial d-dimensional feature space to a k-dimensional feature subspace where k < d. The motivation behind feature selection algorithms is to automatically select a subset of features that are most relevant to the problem to improve computational ef ciency or reduce the generalization error of the model by removing irrelevant features or noise, which can be useful for algorithms that don't support regularization. A classic sequential feature selection algorithm is Sequential Backward Selection (SBS), which aims to reduce the dimensionality of the initial feature subspace with a minimum decay in performance of the classi er to improve upon computational ef ciency. In certain cases, SBS can even improve the predictive power of the model if a model suffers from overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea behind the SBS algorithm is quite simple: SBS sequentially removes features from the full feature subset until the new feature subspace contains the desired number of features. In order to determine which feature is to be removed at each stage, we need to de ne criterion function J that we want to minimize. The criterion calculated by the criterion function can simply be the difference in performance of the classi er after and before the removal of a particular feature. Then the feature\n",
    "to be removed at each stage can simply be de ned as the feature that maximizes\n",
    "this criterion; or, in more intuitive terms, at each stage we eliminate the feature that causes the least performance loss after removal. Based on the preceding de nition of SBS, we can outline the algorithm in 4 simple steps:\n",
    "1. Initialize the algorithm with k = d , where d is the dimensionality of the full feature space Xd .\n",
    "2. Determine the feature x− that maximizes the criterion x− = arg max J (Xk − x) where x∈Xk .\n",
    "3. Remove the feature x− from the feature set: X := X − x−;k := k −1.\n",
    "k-1 k\n",
    "4. Terminate if k equals the number of desired features, if not, go to step 2."
